/**
 * @title  GlueHookInvariant — stateful fuzzing of the buyback hook against a REAL Uniswap V4 pool.
 * @notice The hook's two mechanics both settle inside somebody else's swap, and both move value that
 *         belongs to donors. That combination is what makes a stateful campaign worth running: a unit
 *         test sees a successful swap and a happy swapper, and cannot see that the hook's books stopped
 *         matching its balances three fills ago. So this campaign interleaves donations, buys and sells
 *         (exact-input and exact-output) in arbitrary order and asserts:
 *
 *   PP1 POT SOLVENCY        the hook's balance of the secondary covers everything it says it owes
 *   PP2 CONSERVATION        pot + Σ shield payouts + Σ pump spends == Σ donations, exactly. Every wei
 *                           that ever entered a pot is either still there or was spent by a mechanic
 *                           that logged it — the hook cannot lose or invent secondary.
 *   PP3 PRICE UNTOUCHED     a sell the pot absorbed IN FULL left the pool's price bit-identical. This is
 *                           the shield's whole purpose: supply that never reaches the pool
 *   PP4 PUMP BOUNDED        no pump ever spent more secondary than the buy that carried it, so the pot
 *                           can never be drained faster than real demand arrives
 *   PP5 MAIN ATTRIBUTED     every unit of main the hook holds is parked and accounted for; nothing the
 *                           two mechanics acquired is sitting on the hook unowned
 *   PP6 DELIVERY IDENTITY   Σ main acquired == Σ main delivered: burned, dead-sent, held, or parked
 *
 * Plus a deterministic anti-vacuity walk, since the handler swallows reverts and every invariant above
 * is trivially true over an empty world.
 *
 * @dev The real PoolManager is etched from the same Sepolia runtime bytecode the Hardhat fixture injects,
 *      so both layers fuzz the identical venue. The hook itself is deployed to an address carrying the
 *      four permission bits the PoolManager reads out of a hook's address, which is what a real
 *      deployment mines a CREATE2 salt for.
