/**
 * @title  GlueHookProgramInvariant — the stateful campaign with the LP PROGRAM ARMED.
 * @notice {GlueHookInvariant} fuzzes the pump over a bare pool. This campaign runs the SAME random
 *         walk — donations, buys, sells in both modes, time skips, arbitrary order — over a pool whose
 *         LP program is live and armed for in-swap auto-harvest with every split leg switched on at
 *         once: a compound share (with its CARRY), a buyback share fuelling the pot mid-walk, a burn
 *         share walking the cascade, and live per-side recipients being pushed real money inside the
 *         swaps. Everything the program does happens INSIDE the swaps the fuzzer throws, interleaved
 *         with pumps behind buys and sells in the same frames — which is exactly where a bookkeeping slip
 *         between the four ledgers (pot, carry, owed, parked/held) would hide from unit tests.
 *
 *   PI1 ETH SOLVENCY        the hook's ETH balance covers `obligationOf(ETH)` — pots + carry + owed
 *   PI2 TOKEN SOLVENCY      the hook's token balance covers `obligationOf(token)`
 *   PI3 MAIN ATTRIBUTED     every unit of main on the hook is parked, held, carried, or owed — sharper
 *                           than PP5 because the program adds two new ways to hold main
 *   PI4 POT CONSERVATION    pot + Σ pump spends == Σ donations + Σ harvest fuel:
 *                           the harvest's buyback leg is a REAL pot inflow and the identity still
 *                           closes exactly
 *   PI5 DELIVERY IDENTITY   Σ main acquired (pumps + harvest burn legs) == Σ main delivered
 *                           (dead + parked + held + the buyback split's compound credits) — the
 *                           burn cascade loses nothing under load
 *   PI6 LIQUIDITY MONOTONE  the program's liquidity NEVER decreases: nobody removes, so the armed
 *                           auto-compound may only grow the position or stand still
 *
 * Plus a deterministic anti-vacuity walk proving harvests, compounds, fuel, burns and recipient pushes
 * all actually happened under the invariants.
 *
 * @dev Same real PoolManager bytecode, same mined hook address, same handler as the base campaign —
 *      only the program is new. Recipients are fresh EOAs so pushes land (the bounced-push path has
 *      its own deterministic and fuzz coverage: L9, A11, FM9).

/**
 * @title  GlueHookNativeProgramInvariant — the SAME armed walk over a NATIVE program.
 * @notice The program is launched by a registered Glue LP engine (a recording mock), so every
 *         in-swap auto-harvest the fuzzer provokes pushes the remainder legs to the engine, advances
 *         the DELIVERED ledger and fires `recordHarvest`. The engine receives nothing else in this
 *         world (the pot recipient is the burn, nobody removes liquidity), which makes the ledger's
 *         exactly-once claim directly checkable against balances:
 *
 *   PN1 LEDGER == LANDED     `deliveredCumOf(pool, asset)` equals the engine's cumulative balance
 *                            delta in that asset, to the wei, on both assets — the ledger counts
 *                            exactly what the engine received from harvests, never gross, never a
 *                            booked-owed leg
 *   PN2 RECORDED == LEDGER   the engine's own `recordHarvest` sums equal the ledger: with a
 *                            well-behaved engine the callback path attributes everything and a
 *                            reconcile would credit ZERO — callback and reconcile never overlap
 *   PN3 LEDGER MONOTONIC     the ledger never decreases between two observations
 *   PN4 SOLVENCY             the hook's ETH and token balances cover its obligations under the
 *                            native load (the report changes no delivery)
 *
 * Plus a deterministic anti-vacuity walk proving the callbacks really fired with real value.
