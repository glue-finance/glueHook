/**
 * @title  GlueHookHandler — bounded swap-and-donate surface for the pump's stateful fuzzer.
 * @notice Drives the REAL {GlueHook} against the REAL Uniswap V4 PoolManager on a real hooked pool:
 *         donations in random sizes from five actors, buys and sells in both swap modes — every one
 *         of which may carry a pump behind it — and time skips that let the reference tick move,
 *         all interleaved in whatever order the fuzzer picks.
 * @dev    The hook's mechanics are settled inside somebody else's swap, which is exactly the situation
 *         where an accounting slip is invisible to a unit test: the swap succeeds, the swapper is happy,
 *         and the hook's books quietly stop matching its balances. So this handler keeps a ghost ledger
 *         of every wei that entered a pot and every wei a pump spent out of one, reading the amounts
 *         from the hook's OWN events rather than inferring them from balances — an inferred number
 *         would be measuring the thing it is supposed to be checking.
 *
 *         It also records the two properties that can only be observed at the moment of a pump: that
 *         it never spends more than the gated share (48% after the haircut) of the secondary the
 *         carrying swap moved, and that a pump behind a SELL never lifts main's price back above where
 *         the sell started. Both are latched into flags the invariants assert.
 *
 *         Every action swallows its own revert, so the counters below are what prove the surface is live
 *         rather than silently fuzzing an empty world.
