        Every mechanism in this book — the pot, the pump, the gate, the burn cascade, the fee split, the
        compound engine — shares one design constraint: <B>none of it needs a human to run</B>.
        Put together, they turn a Uniswap pool into something new: an LP whose tokenomics are a
        property of its own trading, not an activity someone performs on its behalf. This chapter
        is about that independence — what it replaces, how far it goes, and why it survives the
        team that launched it.
      </Lead>

      <H2>Tokenomics as an activity vs tokenomics as a property</H2>
      <P>
        Almost every tokenomic promise in the market today is an <B>activity</B>: someone at the
        project signs the buyback, someone funds the bot, someone remembers to compound the LP,
        someone runs the keeper that harvests the fees. Activities depend on people — on their
        keys, their attention, their funding, and their continued existence. The moment the person
        stops, the tokenomics stop, and holders usually find out from the chart.
      </P>
      <P>
        A hooked pool inverts this. The buyback fires <B>inside the buy</B> that would have
        benefited from it. The harvest fires <B>inside the swap</B> that generated the fees. The
        compound re-mints those fees into the pool&apos;s own position in the same breath. The burn
        happens on delivery, through a cascade that cannot fail a trade. Nothing on that list has
        an operator — the operator is the traffic.

        untouched, and the pool gravitates to the (optional, full-gas) manual{" "}
        <C>harvest(key)</C>. The <B>carry</B>: minting needs both tokens in the ratio the current
        tick dictates, so the unmatched remainder is never sold, never donated to the market as
        slippage — it waits, and it compounds next round. The exact math lives in{" "}

      <H2>No arbitrageur in the loop</H2>

        This matters more than it looks. Vault-style compounders often <B>swap</B> the fee
        inventory to rebalance it before minting — and every swap pays the fee tier and crosses
        the spread, leaking a slice of your yield to the market (and to whoever arbitrages the
        vault&apos;s predictable flow). The hook&apos;s engine <B>never swaps to rebalance</B>: it
        mints what the budget allows at the live price and carries the rest. Growth costs zero
        spread, zero arbitrage leakage, zero rebalancing fee — the only thing between the fee and
        the position is a floor division.
