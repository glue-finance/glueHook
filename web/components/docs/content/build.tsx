          the pool was fresh, so the admin slot is provably virgin. <C>launchPool</C> records its
          own caller as the admin: exactly what the callback would have recorded had the launcher
          initialized the pool directly. Audited as the LA1–LA10 suite, including the no-spoof

        A live owner can <B>always</B> withdraw — no lock is implied by anything except the

      <P>
        Without this, an owner could time adds and removes to skim fee value past the split (past a
        burn share, past the pot&apos;s fuel). With it, the split is unavoidable: fees settle as
        fees, principal settles as principal.

      <H2>The tick range</H2>
      <P>
        Fixed at creation, forever — <C>(0, 0)</C> resolves to full range. A range position
        concentrates the program&apos;s depth (and its fee earnings) around the price you choose;
        full range never goes out of range and suits the lock-forever shapes. Choose once, choose
        deliberately.

        The hook is public infrastructure: no fee, no owner, no permission to ask. Launchers,
        lockers, vaults and DAOs compose on three primitives — the <B>one-transaction launch</B>,
        the <B>two surrenderable roles</B>, and the <B>recipient hooks</B>.
      </Lead>

      <H2>Pattern 1 — a token launcher</H2>
      <P>
        A launchpad contract deploys the token and calls <C>launchPool</C> in the same transaction:
        pool, pot and seeded LP program, live from block one. The launcher itself becomes the pot
