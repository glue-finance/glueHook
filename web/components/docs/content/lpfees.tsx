        The pool&apos;s LP program earns swap fees in <B>both</B> currencies, and each side has its
        own three-way waterfall — chosen by you, validated at write time, executed identically on
        every harvest. This chapter is the management view: the two flows end to end, why they are

      <H2>Why the two sides are different</H2>
      <P>
        The asymmetry is the machine&apos;s logic, not an arbitrary menu. The <B>secondary</B> side
        is the buyback currency — so its special destination is the <B>pot</B>: a{" "}
        <C>buybackShare</C> makes the pool fund its own buyback pressure from its own traffic,
        forever. The <B>main</B> side is the defended asset — so its special destination is{" "}
        <B>destruction</B>: a <C>burnShare</C> cuts supply at the source, before those tokens ever
        circulate. Sending main to the pot would be pointless (the pot only spends secondary), and
        burning secondary would burn the wrong asset. Each side gets exactly the lever that makes
        sense for what it is.

        <p>
          Compose every failure at once — hostile recipients on both sides, an unburnable token, a
          carry that never fits, an empty pot — and the result is a pool that trades{" "}
          <B>exactly like a hookless Uniswap pool</B>, with value parked in ledgers waiting to be
          claimed. Misconfiguration wastes its own opportunity; it never taxes, delays or blocks a
          trader.

      <H2>What this means for a trader, concretely</H2>
      <P>
        The machine adds <B>no new revert path</B> to a swap: no token behaviour, no configuration,
        no recipient and no pot state can make a trade fail that would have succeeded on a vanilla
        pool. The only overhead a trader ever carries is bounded gas — the pump&apos;s inline
        execution and an occasional auto-harvest under its budget — and the minimums exist
        precisely so the program tunes that cost consciously (see{" "}
        <a className="text-magenta underline" href="/docs/harvest">How harvesting works</a>).
        Trade-side guarantees like &quot;the pump never spends past the four ceilings&quot; are proven wei-exact in
        the{" "}
        <a className="text-magenta underline" href="/docs/security">test campaign</a>.
