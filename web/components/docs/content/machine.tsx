          There is no withdrawal path for a pot — not for the donor, not for the admin, not for
          anyone. The pot exists to be spent on the market, and only the market can spend it. The
          full funding guide — strategies, safety checks, integrations — is the next chapter:{" "}

      <H2>The recipient</H2>
      <P>
        The pot&apos;s <C>recipient</C> decides where bought and absorbed main goes.{" "}
        <C>address(0)</C> means <B>burn</B> — the burn cascade runs (see{" "}
        <a className="text-magenta underline" href="/docs/delivery">Burn &amp; delivery</a>).
        Anything else is a literal delivery target: a treasury, a staking vault, a rewards contract,
        a locker. The pot admin can move it at any time with <C>setRecipient</C>. And when the pool
        carries an LP program, its operator can carve the output <B>before</B> it reaches the
        recipient — a share into the pool&apos;s own liquidity, a share into the burn — with the{" "}

      </P>

      <H2>Who is the pot admin?</H2>
      <P>
        Whoever initialized the pool on the PoolManager — the hook records it in{" "}
        <C>beforeInitialize</C> (or, on a <C>launchPool</C>, the launcher itself). The admin
        declares the roles once (<C>initPot</C> is one-shot), can move the recipient, and is the
        only address that may create the pool&apos;s LP program. The admin has <B>no other
        power</B>: it cannot touch the pot&apos;s balance, block trades, or change the mechanics.

      <Callout tone="warn" title="what admin trust actually means for donors">
        <p>
          Admin trust is scoped to <B>configuration, not funds</B>: a malicious admin can at worst
          re-point where a <B>future</B> buyback&apos;s main is delivered — including to
          themselves. It can never reach donated secondary or parked main. So before donating to a
          pool you don&apos;t control, check <C>potOf(poolId).recipient</C> and who the admin is —
          exactly as you would verify any on-chain destination. A pool whose recipient is{" "}

      <H2>The pot&apos;s spending curve — the math of pacing</H2>
      <P>
        The pot never decides to spend; buys unlock it. Each pump spends at most{" "}
        <C>0.8 · min(pot, f·R, userIn)</C> — three ceilings at once — and that shape gives the pot
        two clean aggregate laws you can compute in your head:

      <P>
        Put together: a <B>100 ETH pot</B> on that pool takes at least <B>42 pump-carrying buys</B>{" "}
        and at least <B>125 ETH of genuine buy volume</B> to spend down. The pot cannot be emptied
        in one block, cannot front-run itself, and always meters its firepower into real demand —
        the drain rate is a function of <B>traffic</B>, not of anyone&apos;s decision. And because{" "}
        <C>R</C> is read live, the ceiling breathes with the pool: deeper liquidity earns bigger
        pumps automatically, a thinning pool throttles itself.

        The sandwich shape: an attacker opens with a buy of size <C>X</C> to summon the pump, the
        pump of size <C>V</C> lands behind it, and the attacker closes by dumping the bag into the
        price bump they financed. Model the pool as depth <C>R</C> (the tangent reserve at the live
        price) with fee <C>f</C>. To leading order:

      <Code title="the break-even, derived">

      <P>
        The attacker&apos;s size <B>cancels out of the inequality</B> — so one single bound on the
        pump&apos;s spend closes the attack for <B>every attacker size, pot depth and price at
        once</B>. The hook caps the pump at <C>f·R</C> and then takes only 80% of it, putting the
        realised spend at <C>0.8·f·R</C> — strictly <B>inside</B> the break-even. The fee ceiling
        itself needs no cooldown and no reference; the 10-minute EMA and the volume-paced bucket
        (next chapter) are extra ceilings on top. This is proven at sizes from dust to pool-scale
        in the test campaign, and it is exactly why a <B>zero-fee pool never pumps</B>: with{" "}
        <C>f = 0</C> the ceiling is zero, and the design refuses to host a sandwichable buyback.
      </P>
      <P>
        Intuition for the same thing: forcing a bigger pump requires a bigger real buy, which pays
        the pool&apos;s fee and impact <B>twice</B> — and the haircut means the pump moves the
        price by less than the attacker paid to trigger it. The &quot;attack&quot; is
        self-financing a donation to the pool&apos;s LPs, while the pot gets its tokens at market
        price either way.

      <H2>The 80-cent theorem</H2>
      <P>
        Push the derivation one step further and the haircut turns into a statement you can quote:
        substitute the hook&apos;s actual spend <C>V = 0.8 · min(f·R, X)</C> into the profit
        formula and divide by the fee bill —

      <P>
        A standing carry is never stuck value — every future harvest retries it, even a harvest
        with zero new fees — but it IS information: persistent one-sided carry on a concentrated
        range is the machine telling you the range no longer matches the market. The lever is the
        owner&apos;s, not the machine&apos;s: liquidity choices stay human, budgets stay automated.
      </P>

      <H2>Sizing the share against your goals</H2>
      <P>
        The share competes with the pot and the recipients for the same gross, so set it from the
        goal backwards: a <B>launch</B> wanting a price floor leans buyback-heavy (the pot works
        immediately, depth pays off later); a <B>mature pool</B> wanting routing share leans
        compound-heavy (depth is what aggregators price); a <B>treasury-funded</B> project can run
        100% compound and let donations do the buyback work. And because the operator can retune
        the shares at any time (until surrendered), the dial is a strategy, not a commitment —{" "}

      <H2>Owner vs operator — why two roles</H2>

        The <B>owner</B> holds the property: liquidity, harvests, and the right to transfer or
        surrender. The <B>operator</B> edits the rules: the split shares, the recipients, the
        minimums, the harvest gate. Splitting them makes the two most-wanted trust promises{" "}
