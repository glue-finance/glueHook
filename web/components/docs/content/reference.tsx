      <H2>The adversarial campaign</H2>
      <P>
        Differential twin-pool parity (a hooked pool must behave wei-identically to a plain one for
        the trader, including under spot manipulation), self-sandwich unprofitability across every
        posture, hostile recipients and tokens (reverting <C>receive()</C>, blocklists,
        fee-on-transfer, no burn function), reentrant donations and reentrant harvest recipients,
        zero-fee refusal, direction discipline, pot isolation across pools, mixed-decimal pairs
        (6/18, 8/18, roles both ways) with magnitude proofs, and the buyback split&apos;s own
        never-stop matrix (a refusing recipient, an unburnable main under a burn share, a hostile
        native recipient, a re-entering recipient — every one fails sideways while the swap lands).
      </P>

      <H2>GH-1 — the one informational finding, in full</H2>
      <P>
        The audit&apos;s single finding walks every sandwich posture around an on-buy buyback, with
        the complete two-sided accounting. The frame that makes it legible:{" "}
        <B>the pot is not a treasury the hook defends — it is a standing buy order.</B> Its mandate
        is to convert its entire inventory into bought-and-burned main at the pool&apos;s own
        execution price, as demand arrives. Every &quot;attack&quot; below is an attempt to make
        the pot trade; the question in each case is not <i>&quot;did the attacker gain?&quot;</i>{" "}
        but <i>&quot;did the pot pay a fair price for real main, capped by real demand?&quot;</i> —
        and in every posture the answer is yes.
      </P>

      <H3>Posture 1 — farming the pump itself: closed</H3>
      <P>
        The attacker buys to summon the pump, then dumps the bag into the bump they financed. The
        sandwich algebra reduces to <C>profitable ⟺ pump spend &gt; f·R</C> — the attacker&apos;s
        own size cancels out — and the pump never spends more than <C>0.8·f·R</C>, strictly inside
        the break-even (the full derivation is in the{" "}
        <a className="text-magenta underline" href="/docs/pump">Pump chapter</a>). Proven
        unprofitable at every size from dust to pool-scale, and refused structurally on zero-fee
        pools where the bound would not hold.
      </P>

      <H3>Posture 2 — sandwiching an unrelated victim&apos;s buy: bounded uplift on a pre-existing attack</H3>
      <P>
        Any buy that lands behind a <B>separate</B> large buy makes that buy marginally more
        profitable to sandwich, because the back-runner sells into a price lifted by both. Measured
        against the fee-ceiling tuning, the uplift is roughly <B>15–27%</B> over what the same
        sandwich earned with no hook at all. The victim was sandwichable with or without the hook —
        the pump does not create the opportunity, it adds a bounded fraction to one that already
        existed. And the attacker cannot summon the pump for this: it only rides behind the
        victim&apos;s genuine buy, capped by the victim&apos;s own input.
      </P>

      <H3>Posture 3 — self-sandwiching through a partially-absorbing shield: the attacker buys the pot its burn</H3>
      <P>
        The subtlest surface, stated honestly: when a shield quote is tick-bounded, the pot absorbs
        a slice of a dump at the current (attacker-elevated) price without moving the pool, and the
        remainder executes from the un-moved price. A large buy followed by a full dump can
        therefore exit at a better blended price than a hookless pool would give — in the fuzz
        campaign&apos;s worst case, a 60 ETH buy against a ~480 ETH pot netted the attacker{" "}
        <B>~7 ETH</B> while the pot spent <B>~13 ETH</B>. Now read the same episode from the
        hook&apos;s side of the ledger:

      <Lead>
        GlueHook is published under the <B>Business Source License 1.1</B> (BUSL-1.1). The short
        version: the deployed hook is free infrastructure for everyone to <B>use and build on</B> —
        but copying the source to ship your own competing deployment is a different act, and that
        one needs a licence.
      </Lead>

      <H2>The one distinction that matters</H2>
      <P>
        Everything in this documentation — launching pools, integrating donations and quotes,
        building launchpads, lockers, vaults and UIs on top of the canonical deployments — is{" "}
        <B>using</B> the hook. Using a deployed contract is not governed by the source licence at
        all: no permission, no fee, no attribution required. It is exactly what the hook was
        designed for.
      </P>
      <P>
        What the licence restricts is <B>forking</B>: taking the source (or a modified copy of it),
        deploying it yourself, and turning it into a product. That is production use of the
        Licensed Work, and under BUSL-1.1 it requires a grant from the licensor until the Change
        Date. If your plan is &ldquo;this hook, but ours&rdquo; — talk to us first.
      </P>

      <Callout tone="good" title="build on it — that's the point">
        Calling <C>launchPool</C>, <C>donate</C>, <C>quotePump</C>, <C>harvest</C> or any other
        function on the canonical address, from any product, commercial or not, is unconditionally
        fine. The address is the same on every network precisely so that building on it is easy.
      </Callout>
      <Callout tone="warn" title="don't fork it into a product">
        Re-deploying this code (or a derivative of it) as your own hook, protocol or service is
        outside the licence grant. Reading, auditing, modifying and testing the source — any
        non-production use — is explicitly free for everyone, today.
      </Callout>

      <H2>The parameters</H2>
      <T
        head={["parameter", "value"]}
        rows={[
          [<B key="1">License</B>, "Business Source License 1.1"],

        ]}
      />
      <P>
        On the Change Date the licence converts automatically: the whole codebase becomes GPL
        v2.0-or-later and every restriction above ends. Until then, additional production grants
        can be published on-chain at the ENS record — so a grant, once given, is as public and
        verifiable as the code itself.
      </P>

      <H2>What this means in practice</H2>

        head={["you want to…", "licence answer"]}

      <P>
        The full text lives in <C>LICENCE.txt</C> at the repository root and in the verified source
        on every explorer. When in doubt, the test is simple: if your product <B>calls</B> the
        canonical address, you are a user; if your product <B>is</B> a copy of this code, you need
        a grant.
