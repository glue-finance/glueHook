        the pool&apos;s buyback currency. Anyone can fuel it — the token team, a protocol treasury,
        a community member, another contract. The pot spends itself through two mechanics, both

        <p>
          Neither. It is a single immutable contract with <B>zero protocol fee</B>, no token, no
          owner and no upgrade path. The only fee anywhere is the pool&apos;s own Uniswap LP fee,
          which goes to liquidity providers as always.
        </p>
      </Faq>
      <Faq q="Do I have to use every feature?">
        <p>
          No. A pool can run just the pot (buybacks only), just the LP program (compounding only),
          both, or neither side armed — every rule is opt-in and most can be changed later by the
          roles that own them.
        </p>
      </Faq>
      <Faq q="Who can trigger the machine?">
        <p>
          Nobody has to. The pump and the shield fire inside ordinary swaps; the auto-harvest fires
          inside ordinary swaps once fees pass your minimums. Manual entries (<C>harvest</C>,{" "}
          <C>flushDirect</C>, <C>claim</C>) exist as permissionless or role-gated fallbacks.

export function Why() {
  return (
    <>
      <Lead>
        Everyone wants buybacks and self-growing liquidity. Almost nobody can automate them —
        because every known design ends in a <B>price oracle</B>, a <B>keeper bot</B>, or{" "}
        <B>someone on the team pressing buttons</B>. This chapter is the argument for doing it
        inside the trades instead.
      </Lead>

      <H2>The two ways buybacks are done today</H2>
      <T
        head={["approach", "how it works", "what you trust"]}
        rows={[
          [
            <B key="m">manual</B>,

            <B key="o">oracle-fed</B>,
            "a keeper bot reads a price feed and fires a transaction",
            "the oracle, the keeper, AND the gap between them (a lagging feed is an arbitrage faucet)",

            <B key="g">GlueHook</B>,
            "the pot executes inside other people's swaps, priced by the pool's own arithmetic at the moment of execution",
            "the code — verified, immutable, at one address everywhere",
          ],
        ]}
      />

      <P>
        The trade-off is stated plainly: the mechanism narrows <B>who decides when</B> — nobody
        decides, the market does — which removes discretionary control, and in exchange it
        automates the buyback on the users&apos; <B>own financial incentives</B>. Buyers trigger
        pumps because buying is what they came to do; sellers trigger the shield because selling is
        what they came to do.
      </P>

      <H2>The second gap: fees that never compound</H2>
      <P>
        In Uniswap V2, fees accrued <B>inside</B> the reserves and every LP position grew
        automatically. V3 and V4 park fees <B>outside</B> the position, so in practice they are
        collected by keeper services, position managers… or never. The hook&apos;s LP program gives
        a pool <B>native auto-compounding</B>: a configurable share of every harvest is re-minted
        into the position <B>inside the swaps that generated the fees</B> — same no-keeper,
        no-oracle, traffic-powered trigger as the buyback itself.
      </P>

      <Callout tone="good" title="what immutability buys you">
        <p>
          The hook has no owner, is not upgradable and takes no protocol fee. Nothing you build on
          it can be rugged from above: no parameter anyone can flip on you, no fee switch, no proxy
          admin. The code you see is the code that runs, on every network, forever.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <H2>Why a V4 hook and not a wrapper or a router</H2>
      <P>
        Only a hook executes <B>inside</B> the swap: the shield needs to intercept the sell before
        the pool prices it (<C>beforeSwap</C>), and the pump needs to ride the buy that unlocked it
        (<C>afterSwap</C>). A router can be bypassed; a wrapper fragments liquidity. The hook is
        part of the pool&apos;s identity — every venue, aggregator and bot that routes through the
        pool feeds the machine, whether it knows it or not.
